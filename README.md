## Hi, My Name is Nidhi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate individual with a keen interest in data exploration and analysis, dedicated to promoting diversity within the tech industry.

I love what I do and I am always happy to chat.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nidhiudayshastry)


## About Me: 

I am a driven data enthusiast based in Perth, Australia, currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of Western Australia. With a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I bring a strong skill set in Python, SQL, R, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.

During my internship at AYLA Solutions, I developed an Economic Indicator Dashboard and created a machine learning model to predict air ticket prices. Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively contribute to the Data Science Club at UWA and engage in volunteer work with organizations like UniStart UWA and Gosnells Toy Library.

I am a proactive team player passionate about leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and solutions.

I am always up for a chat so if you would like to nerd out on any topic please get in touch.
